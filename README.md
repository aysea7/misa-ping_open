This app was created for me and my medical university classmates. It can be used either as a Telegram bot or as an executable file that opens a CMD (a matter of preference). It pings the website with the test assessments called MISA, so that we could know when it's up again after a downtime (happens frequently when the missiles attack the electricity infrastructure).
